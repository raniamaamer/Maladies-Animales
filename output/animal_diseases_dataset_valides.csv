According to the tests, the other animals on the farm show no signs of illness, regardless of this, quarantine was ordered. The disease causes serious economic damage in the region, as North Rhine-Westphalia loses its disease-free status - and this means trade restrictions in relation to animal species susceptible to bluetongue. The first cases of the current wave were detected in August on sheep farms in Spain, and then discovered by the Dutch authorities at the beginning of September. Typically, the presence of the virus was detected on sheep farms, and today nearly 40 livestock farms are affected in North Holland and the province of Utrecht. However, animals have already tested positive for the virus on some cattle farms. The virus serotype 3 is responsible for the disease in the region, which produces ...

The warning follows the confirmation of EHD in France, and the recent spread of bluetongue (BTV) across Europe. EHD was confirmed for the first time in Europe in October 2022 in Italy. It has since spread to Portugal, Spain, before reaching France. The disease affects deer most severely, but clinical cases have been reported in cattle at multiple farms in these countries. Several strains of BTV have been circulating in Europe, with nearly 800 outbreaks confirmed. The Netherlands reported their first outbreak of BTV since 2009 in September, followed by the Belgium authorities in October. Last month, French authorities confirmed the presence of a new strain of the disease, BTV-8, which is causing more severe clinical signs in cattle and sheep. DAERA DAERA is advising farmers to carefully consider the disease risks associated with sourcing animals from areas in mainland Europe where the viruses have been detected. The department added that imported animals found to be infected with BTV will be slaughtered. In addition, no compensation will be paid, and movement restrictions will be placed on the holding for several months while extensive surveillance is carried out to rule out further spread. Housing and isolation of imported pregnant animals will also be required until the birth of the progeny, which must be tested with negative results before restrictions will be lifted. Northern Ireland’s chief veterinary officer (CVO), Dr. Robert Huey said as both bluetongue and EHD are windborne vector diseases transmitted through midges, the main risk for Northern Ireland is the importation of infected animals. “This was the case in December 2018, when the last detection of BTV was discovered in Northern Ireland, as part of the department’s routine post-import testing regime,"" Dr. Huey said. ""The disease was detected in a heifer imported from France to a holding in Northern Ireland. “I would strongly encourage farmers to follow the DAERA guidance and to be aware of the significant risks and the potentially adverse consequences, both for themselves and for the industry, of importing animals from, or transiting through affected areas. “An incursion of bluetongue or Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease to Northern Ireland would result in the loss of disease-free status which would be devastating for the industry, he added. Farmers DAERA has offered the following advice to farmers: Anyone who imports animals from a bluetongue affected area must ensure that the animals have been vaccinated against the disease prior to import; If the animals are pregnant, the vaccination must have been carried out so that the animal was immune before mating; These are legal requirements and conditions must be attested to by the certifying official veterinarian on the health certificate; Farmers should also consider seeking additional guarantees from the seller such as a pre-export test to prove effective immunity; If you choose to bring animals into Northern Ireland from a disease-free zone via a bluetongue infected zone you must ensure you comply with all the conditions on the export health certificate. This should include the treatment of animals and vehicles with an approved insecticide and ensuring all parts of the health certificate for the imported animals have been met. Bluetongue affects all ruminants, such as cattle, goats, deer and sheep. Symptoms may include: Fever; swelling of the head and neck; lameness; inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes; drooling; and there is often a high mortality rate. EHD affects deer most severely, but clinical cases have been reported in cattle at multiple farms in affected European countries.

Vendredi 13 octobre, le GDS (Groupement de défense sanitaire) de la Loire informait sur la situation vis-à-vis de la FCO (Fièvre catarrhale ovine), donnant suite « aux récentes suspicions cliniques de FCO/MHE effectuées par des vétérinaires pour des éleveurs de la Loire. Sept d’entre elles ont été confirmées en FCO 8. La majorité concerne des troupeaux bovins et un troupeau ovin. » Ces résultats confirment que « la FCO 8 circule dans la Loire à ce jour ». Le communiqué du GDS précise que « cela n’implique pas de modifications des conditions d’échange. En revanche, l’impact clinique reste relativement important, notamment pour des animaux adultes. La désinsectisation et la gestion des vecteurs plus globalement sont un outil de prévention qui est toujours important ». Quant à la MHE (Maladie hémorragique épizootique), la détection de tout nouveau foyer entraîne des mesures de lutte et de prévention spécifiques dans un rayon de 150 km autour des foyers. Le 13 octobre, le département de la Loire n’était pas concerné, ni par des cas, ni par une zone réglementée. Zone réglementée au Sud et à l’Est À la date du 12 octobre, 453 foyers de MHE avaient été recensés en France dans des élevages. Ces foyers concernent les départements suivants : Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Hautes-Pyrénées, Haute-Garonne, Gers, Landes, Ariège. Le GDS précise que « le nombre de foyers a augmenté de manière importante dans le Sud-Ouest, passant de 50 à 140 foyers déclarés au cours de la semaine écoulée ». Néanmoins, la zone réglementée dans cette région « n’évolue que très peu géographiquement ». Les recommandations du GDS restent les mêmes que pour la FCO : gestion des vecteurs, et notamment la désinsectisation pour limiter la transmission du virus par les culicoïdes (moucherons piqueurs) entre les animaux. Le ministère de l’Agriculture indique que « dans les élevages infectés, le nombre d’animaux atteint est inférieur à 3 %. La mortalité constatée reste par ailleurs très faible (inférieure à 0,1 %). Une étude est engagée dans des élevages infectés pour consolider ces données. Les soins mis en œuvre permettent, dans la quasi-totalité des cas, une guérison des animaux malades en quelques jours. » L’évolution concernant la MHE est localisée à l’Est de la France. Effectivement, la Suisse a enregistré, durant la semaine du 9 octobre, son premier foyer, à proximité de Berne. « Cela implique une nouvelle zone réglementée sur certaines communes des départements notamment de l’Ain, des Savoie, du Jura, du Doubs, de Saône-et-Loire ou d’Alsace, etc. » Dans son communiqué, le GDS rappelle les règles de mouvement des animaux en lien avec la MHE : - les mouvements nationaux entre zone réglementée et zone indemne se font sous couvert d'une désinsectisation et d'une PCR dans les sept jours avant mouvement ; - pour les bovins provenant des zones indemnes (cas de la Loire), rien ne s'oppose au maintien des mouvements dans l’Union européenne des bovins selon des modalités inchangées. Exportations Le ministère de l’Agriculture annonçait, dans un communiqué daté du 12 octobre, que « les autorités sanitaires italiennes viennent de donner leur accord à une réouverture des importations de jeunes bovins destinés à l’engraissement (broutards) à partir de l’ensemble du territoire français ». Premier débouché des broutards français (870 000 animaux en 2022), l’Italie avait fermé ses frontières aux bovins issus de la zone réglementée de 150 km autour des foyers de MHE. L’accord avec Rome « sera formalisé dans les prochains jours », précise la Rue de Varenne. Il prévoit notamment que les animaux « devront être désinsectisés et testés avant leur départ ». Cité dans le communiqué, le ministre de l’Agriculture a salué « un énorme soulagement pour nos filières d’élevage ». « Le sérieux des mesures de gestion et de surveillance mises en œuvre, ainsi que l’excellence du dispositif de suivi sanitaire français ont largement contribué à ce résultat favorable », s’est-il félicité. Le 3 octobre, Marc Fesneau avait annoncé la réouverture de l’Espagne, deuxième débouché avec 86 000 têtes. Quant à l’Algérie, la troisième destination (69 000 animaux en 2022), elle est encore fermée. « Reconnaissons que c’est plus complexe », avait admis M. Fesneau le 3 octobre, évoquant une réouverture « sans doute dans un temps un peu plus long ». De son côté, le GDS de la Loire annonçait, le 13 octobre, que « les exportations vers la Tunisie ont repris pour les bovins provenant uniquement de départements situés en dehors de la zone réglementée ». Dans un communiqué du 12 octobre, la FNB (Fédération nationale bovine, FNSEA) demandait une « prise en charge par l’État » des surcoûts dus au maintien des animaux en ferme. L’Italie refusait jusque-là les bovins vifs issus de la zone réglementée d’un rayon de 150 km autour des foyers de MHE (maladie hémorragique épizootique). Les éleveurs d’une quinzaine de départements du Sud de la France étaient donc « contraints de maintenir les animaux sur les exploitations », avec à la clé des « surcoûts » et des « frais sanitaires ». Par ailleurs, « la valeur des animaux ne doit en aucun cas être affectée », souligne la FNB, ajoutant que « le marché demeure très favorable avec une offre réduite du fait de la décapitalisation ». À plus long terme, « l’enjeu est à la déclassification de la maladie au plan européen » , rappelle son président Patrick Bénézit, cité dans le communiqué. La réouverture de l’Italie « participe à lever la tension qui s’exerçait progressivement sur les éleveurs de la zone réglementée », se félicite l’association spécialisée de la FNSEA.

Jura « Covid de la vache » en Suisse : quelles conséquences pour le Jura ? La maladie hémorragique épizootique (MHE) a été détectée sur des bovins, la semaine du 9 octobre, à proximité de Berne, en Suisse. Une zone réglementée de 150 km a été établie autour du foyer, englobant plus de 450 communes jurassiennes. Pour éviter la propagation, des contraintes sont appliquées pour les éventuels déplacements d’animaux hors de la zone. Arnaud Bastion - 19 oct. 2023 à 06:00 | mis à jour le 19 oct. 2023 à 09:59 - Temps de lecture : Lire dans l'application | Les montbéliardes du Jura ne sont, pour l’heure, pas atteintes par la maladie mais sont concernées par la zone réglementée. Illustration Philippe Trias La maladie est apparue dans le sud de l’Europe en octobre 2022. Depuis quelques semaines, l’expression « Covid de la vache » (« Covid de las vacas » en espagnol) est utilisée de l’autre côté des Pyrénées pour parler de la maladie hémorragique épizootique (MHE). Mais à part provoquer de la fièvre, des difficultés respiratoires ou le nez qui coule, les comparaisons avec le Covid-19 s’arrêtent là. La MHE ne se transmet pas directement entre animaux infectés. Ce sont des moucherons, des Culicoïdes, eux-mêmes contaminés, qui véhiculent le virus. La maladie affecte les ruminants sauvages et domestiques et, dans une moindre mesure, les ovins et caprins. Les services de l ’État précisent que la MHE « n’est pas transmissible à l’homme » et que « la consommation de la viande est sans danger ». « Les symptômes sont très proches de la fièvre catarrhale ovine (FCO). La seule solution pour confirmer la MHE est l’analyse de sang. Pour l’heure, il n’y a pas de vaccin mais les vétérinaires peuvent intervenir pour soigner les symptômes et soulager les animaux », détaille Franck Morel, directeur du GDS (Groupement départemental de défense sanitaire) du Jura, entité qui assure des missions déléguées par l’État, notamment l’accompagnement des éleveurs dans leurs actions sanitaires. Avec le foyer identifié récemment en Suisse, le préfet du Jura a pris, conformément aux dispositions prévues au niveau national d’établir une zone réglementée de 150 km autour du foyer, un arrêté en date du 16 octobre pour lister les 458 communes concernées, soit plus de 90 % du département. Des contraintes chronophages Le déplacement des animaux en dehors du périmètre est conditionné au respect de plusieurs mesures telles que la désinsectisation des bêtes au moins 14 jours avant le voyage et le dépistage sanguin (pour analyse PCR) à partir du 15e jour. Le résultat, qui doit être négatif, est valable au maximum 7 jours. « Ce sont des contraintes très chronophages pour l’éleveur. Sans parler du coût des tests PCR », précise Franck Morel. Selon lui, les principales difficultés vont concerner le transport des veaux, notamment les mâles, vendus bien souvent en dehors de la Franche-Comté. « Si le froid s’installe, la circulation vectorielle par les moucherons devrait diminuer. Mais même si, en France, nous avons très peu de recul sur cette maladie, elle ne devrait pas décimer des cheptels », avance le directeur du GDS. À part dans des élevages de bovins du sud-ouest en septembre 2023, aucun autre cas n’est recensé en France. Les sorties des zones réglementées restent donc, pour le moment, limitées. À noter que le ministère de l’agriculture indique que « dans les élevages infectés, le nombre d’animaux atteint est inférieur à 3 %. La mortalité constatée reste par ailleurs très faible (inférieure à 0,1 %) ». « Un peu d’inquiétude pour la vente des veaux » Dans un département où les élevages bovins sont essentiellement à production laitière, les veaux sont voués, pour la plupart, à quitter le Jura. C’est ce point qui semble surtout préoccuper les agriculteurs. « Il y a un peu d’inquiétude pour la vente des veaux. Les mâles sont vendus, élevés et engraissés pour la filière viande en dehors du Jura et même, bien souvent, en Espagne. En général, ils partent lorsqu’ils sont âgés entre 15 jours et 1 mois. Il y a pas mal de vêlages en ce moment et tous les agriculteurs n’auront pas la capacité de les garder en attendant que la situation se décante », relate Philippe Cornu, président des Jeunes agriculteurs du Jura, qui précise que les ventes françaises pourraient être priorisées. L’autre crainte se situe au niveau de l’exportation de génisses. « Souvent, elles partent lorsqu’elles sont proches du terme. Cela pourrait donc aussi compliquer la tâche des éleveurs. » A.B Agriculture Économie Santé Jura Fil Info ► Signaler une erreur dans cet article 0 commentaire COMMENTAIRES SUIVANTS Réagir Articles les plus lus Économie 1 Rhône.

Une nouvelle calamité pour les exploitants agricoles ? L’affaire n’est – heureusement – pas aussi limpide quand on évoque l’arrivée sur le territoire de cette contagion frappant les élevages de bovins : il s’agit de la MHE (pour maladie hémorragique épizootique). La rédaction vous conseille Maladie hémorragique épizootique : 12 foyers dans les Pyrénées-Atlantiques Au 5 octobre, le ministère de l’Agriculture recensait 53 foyers de la maladie qui progresse parmi les élevages de bovins, dont 30 dans les Hautes-Pyrénées. Il y a quelques jours, le nombre de cas découverts semblait en pleine explosion (près de 2000 selon le ministère), impactant notamment les Pyrénées-Atlantiques et plus encore nos voisins bigourdans (ainsi que la Haute-Garonne, le Gers, les Landes… et depuis ce samedi l’Aude et l’Ariège ) On sait que ce virus est une maladie infectieuse, susceptible d’affecter gravement les bovins mais dans des proportions encore limitées (3 % des troupeaux ; - de O, 5 % de décès). Victimes de fièvres, les animaux contaminés, en situation de détresse respiratoire, ne s’alimentent plus. L’origine du problème serait à rechercher du côté de moucherons piqueurs responsables de la transmission. Pour autant, et même si aucun vaccin n’existe à ce jour, il est important de préciser que la MHE n’est ni contagieuse, ni transmissible à l’homme. L’export en question Ceci dit, l’impact sur l’élevage de bovins est réel. Des mesures de surveillances des élevages contaminés ont été mises en place par les autorités, avec des « zones tampons » , un peu à la manière du dispositif connu pour lutter contre la grippe aviaire. Ces derniers jours ont toutefois permis d’engranger plusieurs bonnes nouvelles pour les éleveurs. Localement, c’est d’abord la réouverture de l’important marché de Rabastens-de-Bigorre (65) qui a été actée. La rédaction vous conseille En Auvergne, Marc Fesneau tente de rassurer les éleveurs On note également l’autorisation donnée par l’Espagne, elle aussi touchée par cette maladie depuis un an, de reprendre les exportations de jeunes bovins français. L’intérêt au plan économique n’est pas neutre, d’autant que l’Italie a ensuite pris la même décision. Recours à l’État Toutefois, dans le milieu agricole, l’inquiétude demeure et l’État est fermement « invité » à venir au soutien en prenant en compte les pertes redoutées. Plusieurs syndicats, tels que le Modef et la Confédération paysanne, demandent entre autres « une relocalisation de l’activité d’engraissement ». Et ce, dans le but « de moins dépendre des exportations ». D’autres organisations, telles que la Coordination rurale d’Aquitaine, vont dans le même sens en évoquant « la responsabilité de l’État au niveau de l’accompagnement d’éleveurs qui ne disposent que de moyens de lutte très limités ». À propos de cette maladie « proche de la fièvre catarrhale ovine » (FCO), elle pointe aussi le coût élevé des soins vétérinaires : « de l’ordre de 250 € à 600 € par animal » selon les calculs de la coordination rurale. Pas mal de cas, peu de mortalité Les interlocuteurs rencontrés au lycée agricole de Montardon, lors d’une journée dédiée à la filière Lait (lire par ailleurs), n’ignorent évidemment rien de la situation. Mais ils ne forcent pas non plus le trait. « Ce n’est pas une catastrophe comparable à la grippe aviaire », expose par exemple d’emblée Jean-Luc Pourtau. En charge du suivi des éleveurs pour la chambre d’agriculture, ce technicien salarié insiste plutôt sur « cette contrariété supplémentaire qui risque de faire baisser les prix ». « Heureusement », enchaîne-t-il, « le taux de mortalité est faible et la maladie n’est pas contagieuse. Mais les cas sont nombreux, ces derniers temps, et en attendant qu’une immunité collective s’impose, il y a la question de la prise en charge des soins ». Elle se pose avec d’autant plus d’acuité, selon Jean-Luc Pourtau, « qu’il faudra sûrement attendre la baisse des températures pour voir ralentir le développement de la MHE ». La rédaction vous conseille Grippe aviaire : inédite en France, la vaccination des canards est lancée Plus de 60 millions de canards vont être vaccinés contre la grippe aviaire d’ici la fin de l’année, dont environ 50 000 dans les Pyrénées-Atlantiques rien que cette première semaine. Pour toute la filière, c’est le soulagement. Sarah Consuegra, la responsable d’exploitation de Montardon, à la tête d’un cheptel conséquent (160 têtes et une cinquantaine de Blondes d’Aquitaine), se félicite certes de ne déplorer, pour l’heure, « aucun cas ». Mais « c’est un problème de plus », souffle la jeune femme qui, « informée il y a 3 semaines », s’est appliquée au déclenchement des protocoles vétérinaires strictement observés. Résultat : « tous nos animaux sont déjà traités ». La vigilance est ici d’autant plus de mise « qu’on doit », d’une part, « gérer beaucoup de passages sur l’exploitation ». Par ailleurs, complète la directrice, « nous avons peur qu’un cas de MHE arrive alors que les vaches sont plus fragiles à la fin de la période de gestation ». Comme dit précédemment, et même s’il reste modeste, l’impact économique induit par cette maladie hémorragique épizootique est aussi à prendre en compte. « Nous envoyons une trentaine de veaux à l’export et, cette fois, le prix a été baissé d’une trentaine d’euros par tête », confirme Sarah Consuegra. Quand la filière Lait innove face au dérèglement climatique C’était une première, portée par l’Agrocampus au lycée agricole de Montardon. Baptisé « Rencontres Lait », ce rendez-vous fructueux, dédié aux éleveurs du sud de la région Nouvelle-Aquitaine, visait à assurer une diffusion plus large des récentes innovations techniques grâce, notamment, à l’expertise apportée par le programme « AccélairR » (« action pour le climat et l’économie laitière régionale »). Destiné à créer du lien afin de mener des travaux communs en matière d’adaptation au changement climatique, d’autonomie alimentaire, d’empreinte carbone, etc., cet outil est financé par le Conseil régional. Concrètement, il permet par exemple de réfléchir à l’efficacité des structures en dur (bâtiments agricoles, lieux de traites…) quand la météo s’enflamme et peut nuire au confort des animaux. Autre exemple : comment faire durer une prairie et donc obtenir des productions fourragères de qualité alors que les périodes sèches tendent à s’allonger ? Le dérèglement climatique à l’œuvre vient brutalement percuter des certitudes, chambouler aussi des habitudes de travail. D’où la nécessité d’en parler… Voilà pourquoi, « à la suite de 4 ou 5 étés tous différents », et après aussi « des accidents climatiques à répétition », il est important de dire aux éleveurs « qu’il faut lever le nez du guidon, être plus opportuniste », résume Marie-Claude Mareaux, l’une des intervenantes de la journée. Cette technicienne de la chambre d’agriculture a invité son auditoire « à sortir des schémas habituels » en se tournant davantage « vers des cultures plus estivales qui supportent mieux un temps sec ». En fait, il s’agit de « ne pas mettre tous les œufs dans le même panier », en l’occurrence celui de la maïsiculture. « Nous sommes ici dans un pays de cocagne où tout pousse ! Il y a donc, peut-être, eu une baisse de vigilance », tente-t-elle d’analyser, appelant de ses vœux « le développement de cultures plus résilientes pour tout simplement avoir de quoi faire bouffer son troupeau ! » Lors de son intervention, Julien Ladonne s’est placé, lui, sur le terrain de l’innovation, proposant « une option intéressante quand les bonnes pratiques ne suffisent plus ». Ce salarié de la fédération des Cuma, en Pyrénées-Atlantiques et dans les Landes (soit 400 adhérents représentant 10 000 agriculteurs) invite le monde agricole à « se réinventer un peu », histoire aussi de moins subir « le nouveau cadre climatique qui nous est imposé ». Joignant la parole au geste, il a donc présenté un nouvel outil, « déjà utilisé sur des stades », et conçu en Hollande. Il s’agit « d’un type de semoir spécifique pour les prairies, nommé Vrédo (coût à l’unité : 30 000 € environ). « Il permet de réaliser directement de nouveaux semis », dévoile Julien Ladonne, « sans avoir à retravailler le sol ni prendre le risque de l’épuiser. C’est, pour l’agriculteur, un vrai gain de temps et de coût aussi ». Des considérations qui, vu le contexte, incitent forcément les acteurs de la filière à tendre l’oreille.

La maladie progresse en France depuis fin Août 2023 en provenance du Sud Ouest. L'Ain n'est pour l'heure pas touché par cette maladie mais il est très probable que des cas soient detéctés dans le département d'ici la fin d'année. Des bovins en provenance de la zone régulée MHE sont arrivés dans l'Ain et ont été dépistés positifs à l'introduction. Cet événement ne fait pas évoluer la zone régulée car ce sont des cas introduits mais la plus grande vigilance est de mise et la vaccination des troupeau est fortement recommandée. Situation sanitaire L’épizootie de MHE poursuit sa progression en France. Les conséquences du passage viral de MHE en élevage sont graves. Les troupeaux touchés l'année dernière ont en moyenne observé 25% d'animaux malades (essentiellement en élevage bovin) avec pour la plupart d'importants symptômes locomoteurs et des inflamation/ulcèration de la gueule empéchant pendant plusieurs jours les animaux atteints de boire et de manger. L'Ain n'est pour l'heure pas en zone régulée MHE. De nouveaux foyers sont chaque jour recensés et font évoluer la zone régulée qui atteindra sans doute l'Ain dans les mois à venir : Vaccins Un seul vaccin est disponible sur le marché : Epizovac. Il est pris en charge par l'état dans les départements qui constituent la frontière entre zone régulée et zone indemne, l'Ain n'est donc à ce jour pas concerné. Cependant le vaccin est quand même disponible sur le marché privé c'est à dire auprès du vétérinaire au même titre que les autres vaccins. Mouvements Les règles aux mouvements tiennent compte des différences entre zone régulée et zone indemne (cas de l’Ain) .

About equine influenza Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease that infects horses, ponies and other equids, such as donkeys, mules and zebras. The virus that causes it is spread via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing; and contact with humans’ contaminated hands, shoes or clothes or contaminated tack, buckets or other equipment. Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106°F); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse’s health at shows by taking his temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread. ​Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof that horses have had an equine influenza vaccination within the six months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from. In addition to vaccinating, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse’s chance of infection and disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

Lors de son discours d'ouverture, le Directeur Général délégué de l'OMSA, le Dr. Abakar Mahamat Nour Mallaye, a souligné que la DGSV, avec le soutien de partenaires techniques et financiers, avait reçu 11 000 000 doses de vaccin contre la PPR et 3 020 000 doses de vaccin contre la PPCB pour la campagne 2022-2023. Ils se sont fixés pour objectif d'atteindre un taux de couverture de 15 % pour la PPR et 20 % pour la PPCB. La campagne prévue pour 2023-2024 doublera ces chiffres, avec 20 000 000 de doses pour la PPR et 6 320 000 doses pour la PPCB. L'objectif principal de cette réunion est d'évaluer la campagne de vaccination de l'édition 2022-2023 afin d'améliorer celle qui vient de débuter. Il s'agit également de discuter des aspects liés à la bonne planification des campagnes de vaccination contre la PPR et la PPCB avec les délégués et les chefs de secteur. Le coordinateur de PRAPS 2, Yacoub Brahim Djouma, a souligné que la lutte contre ces deux maladies est confrontée à divers défis, notamment le respect des calendriers, le marquage des animaux, l'élargissement du nombre de bénéficiaires, la gestion responsable des ressources, et d'autres aspects. La prochaine campagne offre une opportunité pour faire appel aux éleveurs, aux autorités locales, ainsi qu'aux leaders religieux et d'opinion, afin de les impliquer davantage dans les campagnes de vaccination. Dans son discours, le ministre de l'Élevage et des Productions Animales, Pr. Abderahim Awat Atteib, a rappelé que le Tchad s'est engagé à éradiquer la Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) d'ici 2030 et à contrôler la Péripneumonie Contagieuse Bovine (PPCB). La vaccination de masse et le marquage des petits ruminants, ainsi que la vaccination des bovins, ont été identifiés comme des approches efficaces pour atteindre ces objectifs. Les Plans Nationaux Stratégiques (PNS) joueront un rôle essentiel dans la lutte contre la PPR et la PPCB. Pour la campagne de vaccination de l'édition 2022-2023, 11 000 000 de doses de vaccins PPR et 3 020 000 de doses de vaccins PPCB ont été mises à disposition et réparties dans les 23 délégations provinciales de l'Élevage.

C’est la première détection de ce virus en France. Aucun cas humain en revanche n’a été diagnostiqué sur le territoire. Une équipe du Cirad, spécialisée sur les tiques, a détecté le virus de la FHCC dans des tiques de l'espèce Hyalomma marginatum pour la première fois en France. Une équipe du Cirad, spécialisée sur les tiques (Laurence Vial et Célia Bernard), a détecté le virus de la FHCC dans des tiques de l'espèce Hyalomma marginatum pour la première fois en France. © M. Gatius, Cirad Depuis 2015, le Cirad, dans le cadre d’une convention avec la DGAL, étudie et surveille la tique Hyalomma marginatum , un des vecteurs avérés du virus de la Fièvre Hémorragique Crimée-Congo (FHCC). Les études portent notamment sur son aire de répartition, son historique d’invasion en France, sa dynamique saisonnière, ses hôtes, son portage d’agents infectieux. L’objectif est d’évaluer les risques associés à ce vecteur et aux maladies qu’il est susceptible de transmettre. Chaque année, au printemps, des collectes de tiques sont effectuées dans des structures équestres et des élevages bovins. Cette année pour la première fois, une centaine de tiques sur plus de 2000, collectées en 2022 et surtout 2023 au printemps, se sont révélées positives à la présence du virus de la FHCC. Ces résultats ont été confirmés en octobre par le CNR des Fièvres Hémorragiques Virales (FHV) de l’Institut Pasteur. Tiques Hyalomma marginatum. © M. Gatius, Cirad La tique Hyalomma marginatum est une tique dure de relativement grande taille (8 mm), reconnaissable à son rostre long et à ses pattes bicolores (anneaux blanchâtres aux articulations). On la retrouve dans la garrigue ou certaines pâtures du littoral méditerranéen, de la frontière espagnole au Var, jusqu’en Ardèche et dans la Drôme. Sa forme adulte pique les ongulés domestiques et sauvages (bovins, chevaux, sangliers, et dans une moindre mesure les petits ruminants ou cervidés) sans danger pour eux puisque, même infectés par le virus de la FHCC, ces derniers ne développent pas de symptômes. En outre, cette forme adulte peut occasionnellement piquer l’être humain. Elle n’est active qu’au printemps, entre avril et juillet. « Nos collectes ont montré que la tique se répartissait sur l’ensemble du pourtour méditerranéen, dans des habitats naturels ouverts plutôt secs tels que la garrigue ou le maquis. D’après les modèles climatiques futurs, le climat méditerranéen risque de s’étendre, en particulier dans la vallée du Rhône, et sur la côte atlantique à l’ouest, il est probable que l’aire de répartition de cette espèce s’étende » , estime Laurence Vial, vétérinaire acarologue au Cirad, et spécialiste des tiques. Prudence en garrigue, maquis et zone de pâturage entre avril et juillet La fréquence de piqûre à l'être humain est supposée faible, ces tiques n’ayant pas d’appétence particulière pour les êtres humains. De plus, elles sont généralement plus visibles que d’autres espèces de tiques car un peu plus grosses : il est donc plus facile de les repérer et de les retirer avant qu’elles ne se fixent et se gorgent. Le virus de la FHCC peut également se transmettre à l’humain par contact avec des fluides corporels, comme le sang, avec des animaux infectés, en sachant que ces derniers ne restent virémiques qu’une dizaine de jours avant de développer une réponse immunitaire (avec une persistance à vie des anticorps). « En Espagne, le virus FHCC avait été détecté dans des tiques du genre Hyalomma quelques années avant l’apparition de cas humains. Actuellement, un à trois cas humains de fièvre hémorragique sont rapportés chaque année dans ce pays. Toutefois, dans ce pays, c’est une autre espèce de tiques qui est considérée comme le vecteur majoritaire : Hyalomma lusitanicum . En France, la distribution de cette espèce de tique est encore inconnue et nécessite d’être étudiée. Nous sommes peut-être face à un cycle épidémiologique différent, d’où notre prudence à réaliser des comparaisons hâtives entre le cas de l’Espagne et celui de la France » , précise Laurence Vial. Au cœur de MedVallée, un partenariat réussi entre recherche académique et une PME montpelliéraine Ces résultats ont été permis par une collaboration du Cirad avec une entreprise montpelliéraine, Innovative Diagnostics. Fondée en 2004, cette PME employant 180 personnes développe, produit et commercialise des tests diagnostiques sérologiques (ELISA) et de biologie moléculaire (PCR). Ses outils sont utilisés dans le monde entier par des laboratoires publics et privés pour la détection et le contrôle des maladies animales (gamme IDvet), certaines pouvant être transmissibles à l’homme, contribuant ainsi à la prévention des émergences. Innovative Diagnostics, qui dispose déjà d’un kit sérologique pour la détection de la FHCC dont les performances sont reconnues internationalement, a contribué à ces travaux en réalisant l'optimisation et la standardisation des protocoles de détection du virus de la FHCC. Le succès de cette collaboration illustre les bénéfices d’échanges et de partenariats entre le secteur académique et les acteurs économiques, au sein d’un réseau local d’excellence. Les outils innovants obtenus ont permis la détection d’émergences, répondant aux besoins des gestionnaires de santé. Ces travaux s’inscrivent dans le concept de santé globale « One Health », considérant santés humaine, animale, végétale et environnementale comme intimement liées.

Jusqu’en 2021 dans l’Hexagone, les cas humains et équins d’infection à virus West Nile étaient identifiés dans les départements du pourtour méditerranéen (dans les régions Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, Corse et Occitanie). La majorité des cas d'infection à virus du Nil Occidental (environ 80 %) sont asymptomatiques ou peu symptomatiques. Le virus West Nile (ou virus du Nil occidental) gagne du terrain en Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Selon le dernier point épidémiologique de Santé Publique France , alors que les premiers cas humains autochtones régionaux ont été repérés fin juillet, l’organisme en comptabilise 31 au 17 octobre 2023. Virus West Nile : une importante hausse des cas en Nouvelle-Aquitaine Le rapport de Santé publique France précise que les individus infectés par le virus West Nile, repérés en Nouvelle-Aquitaine, ont présenté les premiers symptômes entre mi-juillet et fin septembre. Dans le détail, il a été dénombré 24 cas en Gironde, 5 en Charente-Maritime et 2 en Charente entre fin juillet (date des premiers cas autochtones de la région) et mi-octobre. ""Des investigations sont en cours chez huit autres personnes"" , précise le communiqué. Par ailleurs, 16 chevaux ont aussi développé l’infection (12 en Gironde et 4 en Charente-Maritime) et 6 cas aviaires (en Charente-Maritime) ont été rapportés sur la même période. Pour l'organisme, ces cas témoignent d’une circulation du virus du Nil occidental en Gironde, en Charente-Maritime et en Charente. Un phénomène inquiétant puisque que jusqu’en 2021, les cas d'infections à virus du Nil occidental étaient uniquement observés dans les départements du pourtour méditerranéen (Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, Corse et Occitanie) . ""Moins de 10 cas humains autochtones par an étaient identifiés, excepté en 2018 (épidémie d’ampleur européenne avec 27 cas humains détectés en France) "" , précise l’organisme de santé. En 2022, la Nouvelle-Aquitaine n’avait d’ailleurs enregistré que des cas équins dans le département de la Gironde. SUR LE MÊME THÈME Virus du Nil occidental : 3 cas autochtones identifiés en Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Virus du Nil occidental : 7 cas recensés en Gironde Qu’est-ce que le virus du Nil occidental, qui a fait deux morts en Espagne ? Infection à virus du Nil occidental : comment reconnaître la maladie ? L’infection à virus West Nile (ou virus du Nil occidental) est transmise par les moustiques du genre Culex, insectes endémiques à la France actifs de juin à fin novembre. Ils se contaminent en se nourrissant sur des oiseaux infectés, puis transmettent le virus à l’Homme ou au cheval en les piquant. ""L’Homme et le cheval sont des « impasses épidémiologiques » : un moustique ne peut pas se contaminer en piquant un Homme ou un cheval infecté"" , précise Santé publique France. S’il n’y a pas de transmission interhumaine directe, il est possible d’être infecté par une transfusion sanguine, une transplantation d’organes, de tissus ou de cellules provenant d’un malade. Dans 8 cas sur 10, l’infection à virus du Nil occidental est asymptomatique ou peu symptomatique. Si la personne touchée présente des signes de la maladie, ils sont du type pseudo-grippal : fièvre, douleurs articulaires et musculaires, asthénie, maux de tête. Certains développent par ailleurs une éruption cutanée. Dans de rares cas (moins de 1 %), des complications neurologiques (méningite, encéphalite, polyradiculonévrite) peuvent survenir, notamment chez les personnes immunodéprimées ou âgées, et peuvent conduire au décès.

The individual is a male in his 70s who was likely exposed in Hampden County. The risk of human infection with WNV is moderate in the Greater Boston area (Middlesex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties), and in parts of Berkshire, Bristol, Hampden, Hampshire, Plymouth, and Worcester counties. No risk level changes are associated with this recent case. “Although mosquito activity is decreasing with the cooler weather, some risk from mosquito-borne disease will continue until the first hard frost,” said Dr. Catherine M. Brown, State Epidemiologist. “People should continue to take steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites anytime they are outdoors.” In 2022, there were eight human cases of WNV infection identified in Massachusetts. WNV is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. While WNV can infect people of all ages, people over the age of 50 are at higher risk for severe disease. Most people infected with WNV will have no symptoms. When present, WNV symptoms tend to include fever and flu-like illness. In rare cases, more severe illness can occur. People have an important role to play in protecting themselves and their loved ones from illnesses caused by mosquitoes. Avoid Mosquito Bites Apply Insect Repellent when Outdoors. Use a repellent with an EPA-registered ingredient (DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-Menthane-3,8-diol (PMD)] or IR3535) according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants under two months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under three years of age. Be Aware of Peak Mosquito Hours. The hours from dusk to dawn are peak biting times for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during evening or early morning in areas of high risk. Clothing Can Help Reduce Mosquito Bites. Wearing long-sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin. Mosquito-Proof Your Home Drain Standing Water. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by draining or discarding items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty unused flowerpots and wading pools and change the water in birdbaths frequently. Install or Repair Screens. Keep mosquitoes outside by having tightly fitting screens on all windows and doors. Protect Your Animals Animal owners should reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools – especially after heavy rains. Water troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats and should be flushed out at least once a week to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Owners should also speak with their veterinarian about mosquito repellents approved for use in animals and vaccinations to prevent WNV and EEE. If an animal is suspected of having WNV or EEE, owners are required to report to the Department of Agricultural Resources, Division of Animal Health by calling 617-626-1795, and to the Department of Public Health by calling 617-983-6800. More information, including all WNV and EEE positive results, can be found on the Arbovirus Surveillance Information web page at Mosquito-borne Diseases | Mass.gov, which is updated daily, or by calling the DPH Division of Epidemiology at 617-983-6800.
