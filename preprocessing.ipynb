The virus was diagnosed in a sheep on a farm near the Dutch border, leading to quarantine measures. The virus, which mainly affects cattle, sheep, and goats, is spread by midges and causes severe symptoms in sheep. Disclaimer:The above summary was generated by Tridge's proprietary AI model for informational purposes. Original content After the Netherlands and Belgium, the bluetongue virus was also detected in Germany. The competent authorities diagnosed the disease in a sheep on a farm near the Dutch border. According to the tests, the other animals on the farm show no signs of illness, regardless of this, quarantine was ordered. The disease causes serious economic damage in the region, as North Rhine-Westphalia loses its disease-free status - and this means trade restrictions in relation to animal species susceptible to bluetongue. The first cases of the current wave were detected in August on sheep farms in Spain, and then discovered by the Dutch authorities at the beginning of September. Typically, the presence of the virus was detected on sheep farms, and today nearly 40 livestock farms are affected in North Holland and the province of Utrecht. However, animals have already tested positive for the virus on some cattle farms. The virus serotype 3 is responsible for the disease in the region, which produces ...

         "Latest News Beef Dairy Sheep Tillage Machinery Northern Ireland Videos Podcasts DAERA urges farmers to be vigilant for bluetongue and EHD By Aisling O'Brien October 18, 2023 10:30 AM Share this article The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) is urging farmers to be vigilant for signs of bluetongue and Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease (EHD). The warning follows the confirmation of EHD in France, and the recent spread of bluetongue (BTV) across Europe. EHD was confirmed for the first time in Europe in October 2022 in Italy. It has since spread to Portugal, Spain, before reaching France. The disease affects deer most severely, but clinical cases have been reported in cattle at multiple farms in these countries. Several strains of BTV have been circulating in Europe, with nearly 800 outbreaks confirmed. The Netherlands reported their first outbreak of BTV since 2009 in September, followed by the Belgium authorities in October. Last month, French authorities confirmed the presence of a new strain of the disease, BTV-8, which is causing more severe clinical signs in cattle and sheep. DAERA DAERA is advising farmers to carefully consider the disease risks associated with sourcing animals from areas in mainland Europe where the viruses have been detected. The department added that imported animals found to be infected with BTV will be slaughtered. In addition, no compensation will be paid, and movement restrictions will be placed on the holding for several months while extensive surveillance is carried out to rule out further spread. Housing and isolation of imported pregnant animals will also be required until the birth of the progeny, which must be tested with negative results before restrictions will be lifted. Northern Ireland s chief veterinary officer (CVO), Dr. Robert Huey said as both bluetongue and EHD are windborne vector diseases transmitted through midges, the main risk for Northern Ireland is the importation of infected animals. This was the case in December 2018, when the last detection of BTV was discovered in Northern Ireland, as part of the department s routine post-import testing regime,\" Dr. Huey said. \"The disease was detected in a heifer imported from France to a holding in Northern Ireland. I would strongly encourage farmers to follow the DAERA guidance and to be aware of the significant risks and the potentially adverse consequences, both for themselves and for the industry, of importing animals from, or transiting through affected areas. An incursion of bluetongue or Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease to Northern Ireland would result in the loss of disease-free status which would be devastating for the industry, he added. Farmers DAERA has offered the following advice to farmers: Anyone who imports animals from a bluetongue affected area must ensure that the animals have been vaccinated against the disease prior to import; If the animals are pregnant, the vaccination must have been carried out so that the animal was immune before mating; These are legal requirements and conditions must be attested to by the certifying official veterinarian on the health certificate; Farmers should also consider seeking additional guarantees from the seller such as a pre-export test to prove effective immunity; If you choose to bring animals into Northern Ireland from a disease-free zone via a bluetongue infected zone you must ensure you comply with all the conditions on the export health certificate. This should include the treatment of animals and vehicles with an approved insecticide and ensuring all parts of the health certificate for the imported animals have been met. Bluetongue affects all ruminants, such as cattle, goats, deer and sheep. Symptoms may include: Fever; swelling of the head and neck; lameness; inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes; drooling; and there is often a high mortality rate. EHD affects deer most severely, but clinical cases have been reported in cattle at multiple farms in affected European countries.

The virus was diagnosed in a sheep on a farm near the Dutch border, leading to quarantine measures. The virus, which mainly affects cattle, sheep, and goats, is spread by midges and causes severe symptoms in sheep. Disclaimer:The above summary was generated by Tridge's proprietary AI model for informational purposes. Original content After the Netherlands and Belgium, the bluetongue virus was also detected in Germany. The competent authorities diagnosed the disease in a sheep on a farm near the Dutch border. According to the tests, the other animals on the farm show no signs of illness, regardless of this, quarantine was ordered. The disease causes serious economic damage in the region, as North Rhine-Westphalia loses its disease-free status - and this means trade restrictions in relation to animal species susceptible to bluetongue. The first cases of the current wave were detected in August on sheep farms in Spain, and then discovered by the Dutch authorities at the beginning of September. Typically, the presence of the virus was detected on sheep farms, and today nearly 40 livestock farms are affected in North Holland and the province of Utrecht. However, animals have already tested positive for the virus on some cattle farms. The virus serotype 3 is responsible for the disease in the region, which produces ...

         "Latest News Beef Dairy Sheep Tillage Machinery Northern Ireland Videos Podcasts DAERA urges farmers to be vigilant for bluetongue and EHD By Aisling O'Brien October 18, 2023 10:30 AM Share this article The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) is urging farmers to be vigilant for signs of bluetongue and Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease (EHD). The warning follows the confirmation of EHD in France, and the recent spread of bluetongue (BTV) across Europe. EHD was confirmed for the first time in Europe in October 2022 in Italy. It has since spread to Portugal, Spain, before reaching France. The disease affects deer most severely, but clinical cases have been reported in cattle at multiple farms in these countries. Several strains of BTV have been circulating in Europe, with nearly 800 outbreaks confirmed. The Netherlands reported their first outbreak of BTV since 2009 in September, followed by the Belgium authorities in October. Last month, French authorities confirmed the presence of a new strain of the disease, BTV-8, which is causing more severe clinical signs in cattle and sheep. DAERA DAERA is advising farmers to carefully consider the disease risks associated with sourcing animals from areas in mainland Europe where the viruses have been detected. The department added that imported animals found to be infected with BTV will be slaughtered. In addition, no compensation will be paid, and movement restrictions will be placed on the holding for several months while extensive surveillance is carried out to rule out further spread. Housing and isolation of imported pregnant animals will also be required until the birth of the progeny, which must be tested with negative results before restrictions will be lifted. Northern Ireland s chief veterinary officer (CVO), Dr. Robert Huey said as both bluetongue and EHD are windborne vector diseases transmitted through midges, the main risk for Northern Ireland is the importation of infected animals. This was the case in December 2018, when the last detection of BTV was discovered in Northern Ireland, as part of the department s routine post-import testing regime,\" Dr. Huey said. \"The disease was detected in a heifer imported from France to a holding in Northern Ireland. I would strongly encourage farmers to follow the DAERA guidance and to be aware of the significant risks and the potentially adverse consequences, both for themselves and for the industry, of importing animals from, or transiting through affected areas. An incursion of bluetongue or Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease to Northern Ireland would result in the loss of disease-free status which would be devastating for the industry, he added. Farmers DAERA has offered the following advice to farmers: Anyone who imports animals from a bluetongue affected area must ensure that the animals have been vaccinated against the disease prior to import; If the animals are pregnant, the vaccination must have been carried out so that the animal was immune before mating; These are legal requirements and conditions must be attested to by the certifying official veterinarian on the health certificate; Farmers should also consider seeking additional guarantees from the seller such as a pre-export test to prove effective immunity; If you choose to bring animals into Northern Ireland from a disease-free zone via a bluetongue infected zone you must ensure you comply with all the conditions on the export health certificate. This should include the treatment of animals and vehicles with an approved insecticide and ensuring all parts of the health certificate for the imported animals have been met. Bluetongue affects all ruminants, such as cattle, goats, deer and sheep. Symptoms may include: Fever; swelling of the head and neck; lameness; inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes; drooling; and there is often a high mortality rate. EHD affects deer most severely, but clinical cases have been reported in cattle at multiple farms in affected European countries.

The first cases of the current wave were detected in August on sheep farms in Spain, and then discovered by the Dutch authorities at the beginning of September. Typically, the presence of the virus was detected on sheep farms, and today nearly 40 livestock farms are affected in North Holland and the province of Utrecht.

It has since spread to Portugal, Spain, before reaching France. The disease affects deer most severely, but clinical cases have been reported in cattle at multiple farms in these countries. Several strains of BTV have been circulating in Europe, with nearly 800 outbreaks confirmed. The Netherlands reported their first outbreak of BTV since 2009 in September, followed by the Belgium authorities in October. Last month, French authorities confirmed the presence of a new strain of the disease, BTV-8, which is causing more severe clinical signs in cattle and sheep. DAERA DAERA is advising farmers to carefully consider the disease risks associated with sourcing animals from areas in mainland Europe where the viruses have been detected. The department added that imported animals found to be infected with BTV will be slaughtered. In addition, no compensation will be paid, and movement restrictions will be placed on the holding for several months while extensive surveillance is carried out to rule out further spread. Housing and isolation of imported pregnant animals will also be required until the birth of the progeny, which must be tested with negative results before restrictions will be lifted. Northern Ireland s chief veterinary officer (CVO), Dr. Robert Huey said as both bluetongue and EHD are windborne vector diseases transmitted through midges, the main risk for Northern Ireland is the importation of infected animals. This was the case in December 2018, when the last detection of BTV was discovered in Northern Ireland, as part of the department s routine post-import testing regime,\" Dr. Huey said. \"The disease was detected in a heifer imported from France to a holding in Northern Ireland. I would strongly encourage farmers to follow the DAERA guidance and to be aware of the significant risks and the potentially adverse consequences, both for themselves and for the industry, of importing animals from, or transiting through affected areas. An incursion of bluetongue or Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease to Northern Ireland would result in the loss of disease-free status which would be devastating for the industry, he added. Farmers DAERA has offered the following advice to farmers: Anyone who imports animals from a bluetongue affected area must ensure that the animals have been vaccinated against the disease prior to import; If the animals are pregnant, the vaccination must have been carried out so that the animal was immune before mating; These are legal requirements and conditions must be attested to by the certifying official veterinarian on the health certificate; Farmers should also consider seeking additional guarantees from the seller such as a pre-export test to prove effective immunity; If you choose to bring animals into Northern Ireland from a disease-free zone via a bluetongue infected zone you must ensure you comply with all the conditions on the export health certificate. This should include the treatment of animals and vehicles with an approved insecticide and ensuring all parts of the health certificate for the imported animals have been met. Bluetongue affects all ruminants, such as cattle, goats, deer and sheep. Symptoms may include: Fever; swelling of the head and neck; lameness; inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes; drooling; and there is often a high mortality rate. EHD affects deer most severely, but clinical cases have been reported in cattle at multiple farms in affected European countries.

Par Aisling O'Brien 18 octobre 2023 10h30 Partager cet article Le ministère de l'Agriculture, de l'Environnement et des Affaires rurales (DAERA) exhorte les agriculteurs à être vigilants face aux signes de fièvre catarrhale et de maladie hémorragique épizootique (EHD).Cet avertissement fait suite à la confirmation de l'EHD en France et à la récente propagation de la fièvre catarrhale (BTV) à travers l'Europe.L'EHD a été confirmée pour la première fois en Europe en octobre 2022 en Italie.Elle s'est depuis propagée au Portugal, en Espagne, avant d'atteindre la France.La maladie touche le plus gravement les cerfs, mais des cas cliniques ont été signalés chez des bovins dans plusieurs fermes de ces pays.Plusieurs souches de BTV circulent en Europe, avec près de 800 foyers confirmés.Les Pays-Bas ont signalé leur premier foyer de BTV depuis 2009 en septembre, suivis par les autorités belges en octobre.Le mois dernier, les autorités françaises ont confirmé la présence d'une nouvelle souche de la maladie, le BTV-8, qui provoque des signes cliniques plus graves chez les bovins et les ovins.DAERA DAERA conseille aux agriculteurs d'examiner attentivement les risques de maladie associés à l'approvisionnement en animaux provenant de régions d'Europe continentale où les virus ont été détectés.Le département a ajouté que les animaux importés infectés par le BTV seront abattus.En outre, aucune compensation ne sera versée et des restrictions de déplacement seront imposées sur l'exploitation pendant plusieurs mois, le temps d'une surveillance approfondie pour exclure toute propagation ultérieure.L'hébergement et l'isolement des animaux gravides importés seront également requis jusqu'à la naissance de la progéniture, qui devra être testée avec des résultats négatifs avant que les restrictions ne soient levées.Le vétérinaire en chef de l'Irlande du Nord (CVO), le Dr Robert Huey, a déclaré que la fièvre catarrhale et l'EHD étant des maladies vectorielles transmises par le vent et transmises par les moucherons, le principal risque pour l'Irlande du Nord est l'importation d'animaux infectés.Ce fut le cas en décembre 2018, lorsque la dernière détection du BTV a été découverte en Irlande du Nord, dans le cadre du programme de tests de routine post-importation du département », a déclaré le Dr Huey. « La maladie a été détectée chez une génisse importée de France dans une exploitation en Irlande du Nord.J'encourage fortement les agriculteurs à suivre les directives de la DAERA et à être conscients des risques importants et des conséquences potentiellement néfastes, tant pour eux-mêmes que pour l'industrie, de l'importation d'animaux en provenance ou du transit par des zones touchées.Une incursion de la fièvre catarrhale ou de la maladie hémorragique épizootique en Irlande du Nord entraînerait la perte du statut indemne de maladie, ce qui serait dévastateur pour l'industrie, a-t-il ajouté.Agriculteurs La DAERA a donné les conseils suivants aux agriculteurs : Toute personne qui importe des animaux en provenance d'une zone touchée par la fièvre catarrhale du mouton doit s'assurer que les animaux ont été vaccinés contre la maladie avant l'importation ;Si les animaux sont gravides, la vaccination doit avoir été effectuée de manière à ce que l'animal soit immunisé avant l'accouplement ;Il s'agit d'exigences légales et de conditions qui doivent être attestées par le vétérinaire officiel certificateur sur le certificat sanitaire ;Les agriculteurs devraient également envisager de demander des garanties supplémentaires au vendeur, comme un test préalable à l'exportation pour prouver l'immunité effective ;Si vous choisissez d'introduire des animaux en Irlande du Nord depuis une zone indemne de maladie via une zone infectée par la fièvre catarrhale du mouton, vous devez vous assurer de respecter toutes les conditions du certificat sanitaire d'exportation.Cela devrait inclure le traitement des animaux et des véhicules avec un insecticide approuvé et la garantie que toutes les parties du certificat sanitaire pour les animaux importés ont été respectées.La fièvre catarrhale touche tous les ruminants, comme les bovins, les chèvres, les cerfs et les moutons.Les symptômes peuvent inclure : Fièvre ;gonflement de la tête et du cou ;boiterie;inflammation des muqueuses de la bouche, du nez et des yeux ;baver;et le taux de mortalité est souvent élevé.L'EHD affecte le plus gravement les cerfs, mais des cas cliniques ont été signalés chez des bovins dans plusieurs fermes des pays européens

         "بعد موجة بق الفراش، ترزح العديد من الدول الأوربية حاليا، لاسيما فرنسا تحت مرض آخر يعصف بالقطعان. يتعلق الأمر بمرض النزف الوبائي بين القطعان الذي أعلن عن أولى حالات هذا المرض منذ شهر شتنبر 2023، قبل أن يتفشى بشكل مقلق لدرجة أن فرنسا، أحصت 453 حالة بمختلف مزارع البلاد. هذا الخطر استنفر المكتب الوطني للسلامة الصحية للنتجات الغذائية \"أونسا\" الذي يراقب تطورات انتشار الفيروس بهذه الدول، خصوصا أن المغرب مازال يستورد الأبقار والعجول والأغنام لسد الفجوة بين الطلب والعرض في أسواق المملكة. للإشارة، فإن هذا المرض الحيواني له علامات سريرية مشابهة لأعراض «مرض اللسان الأزرق»، بما في ذلك الحمى وفقدان الوزن وجروح الفم وصعوبات التنفس، لكن مع معدل وفيات منخفض جدا، وحتى اليوم لا يوجد لقاح ضد هذا المرض. لكن المكتب الوطني للسلامة الصحية للمنتجات الغذائية مافتئ يؤكد أن جميع الحيوانات الحية المستوردة تخضع لرقابة صارمة ومنتظمة على مستوى مراكز التفتيش على الحدود، من خلال فحص حالتها الصحية و التحقق من الشهادات والوثائق الصحية وإجراء الفحوصات اللازمة لتحديد الحالة الصحية للقطيع فيما يتعلق ببعض الأمراض الحيوانية المعدية. بعد ذلك،يصدر المفتش البيطري في أونسا شهادة صحية للقبول يضيف المكتب الوطني للسلامة الصحية للمنتجات الغذائية، ثم يسمح فقط للحيوانات السليمة بدخول الأراضي المغربية.",

         "Après la vague de punaises de lit, de nombreux pays européens, notamment la France, souffrent actuellement d'une autre maladie qui ravage les troupeaux.Ceci est lié à l'épidémie de maladie hémorragique des troupeaux, qui a signalé les premiers cas de cette maladie depuis septembre 2023, avant qu'elle ne se propage de manière alarmante au point que la France a dénombré 453 cas dans différents élevages du pays.Ce danger a mobilisé l’Office national de sécurité sanitaire des produits alimentaires (UNSA), qui suit l’évolution de la propagation du virus dans ces pays, d’autant plus que le Maroc continue d’importer des vaches, des veaux et des moutons pour combler l’écart entre l’offre et la demande sur les marchés du Royaume.Pour référence, cette maladie animale présente des signes cliniques similaires à ceux de la « fièvre catarrhale du mouton », notamment de la fièvre, une perte de poids, des plaies buccales et des difficultés respiratoires, mais avec un taux de mortalité très faible, et à ce jour il n’existe aucun vaccin contre cette maladie.Cependant, l'Office National de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits Alimentaires continue de confirmer que tous les animaux vivants importés sont soumis à un contrôle strict et régulier au niveau des centres d'inspection frontaliers, en examinant leur état sanitaire, en vérifiant les certificats et documents sanitaires et en procédant aux examens nécessaires pour déterminer l'état sanitaire du troupeau au regard de certaines maladies animales infectieuses.Après cela, l'inspecteur vétérinaire de l'ONSA délivre un certificat sanitaire d'acceptation auquel est joint l'Office National de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits Alimentaires, et seuls les animaux sains sont alors autorisés à entrer sur le territoire marocain.",
